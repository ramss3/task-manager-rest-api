***Task Manager REST API***

This Task Manager REST API was designed to help users collaborate within teams, so they can efficiently manage tasks. It is enforced role-based access control to teams and tasks. The project follows clean architecture principles, strong validation rules, and explicit domain constraints to ensure data integrity and maintainability.

This API is intended to be used as the backend for a web or mobile application.

📌 ***Overview***

The Task Manager API allows authenticated users to:

- Create, update, and track tasks

- Create and manage teams

- Assign roles to team members 

- Enforce permissions based on team roles

- Secure all endpoints using JWT authentication

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔑 ***Key Features***

👤 ***Authentication & Security***

- JWT‑based authentication

- Secure password handling

- Authentication filter applied to protected endpoints

- Role‑aware authorization logic

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ ***Task Management***

- Create tasks within teams

- Assign tasks to users

- Update task status and metadata

- Fetch task summaries

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

👥 ***Team Management***

- Create and update teams

- Invite users to teams by username or email

- Remove team members

- List team members with assigned roles

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

👤 ***Role‑Based Access Control***

Each team member has a role:

- OWNER –> Full control over the team

- ADMIN –> Can manage members and tasks

- MEMBER –> Can interact with tasks

Role logic is encapsulated directly in an enum for clarity and reuse.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔄 ***Clean DTO Mapping***

- Clear separation between entities and API responses

- Dedicated DTOs for create, update, and response flows

- Centralized mappers for consistency

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


🧪 ***Testability***

- Services structured for unit testing

- Dependency injection throughout the application

- Mock‑friendly service boundaries

⚠️ ***Error Handling***

The API uses custom exceptions for clarity:

- ResourceNotFoundException

- UnauthorizedActionException

- ConflictException

Each exception maps to an appropriate HTTP status code and message.
